# Personal Finance Tracker

## Project Description
This project is a personal finance tracking application built using **C#**. It allows users to log income, expenses, manage budgets, and generate reports. The application demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, and composition, as well as database integration for CRUD operations with SQLite.

## Project Tasks
- [ ] Set up the development environment
- [x] Plan the project
- [ ] Design the database and data models
- [ ] Implement core features
- [ ] Integrate SQLite database
- [ ] Add user interface
- [ ] Test the application
- [ ] Document the project
- [ ] Finalize and submit

## Development Process
This project followed the **Waterfall Methodology**, focusing on completing tasks in sequential order. Key steps included:

1. **Setting up the development environment**
2. **Designing the database schema**
3. **Implementing core features**
4. **Integrating SQLite for CRUD operations**

## Skills Learned
- C# programming
- SQLite database integration
- Git and GitHub for version control
- Testing and debugging techniques
- Writing documentation

## Language Used
- **C#**: For building the application
- **SQLite**: For database storage and management
