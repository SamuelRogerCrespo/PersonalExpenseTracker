#Project Name: Personal Finance Tracker
##Project Description
This project is a personal finance tracking application built using C#. It allows users to log income, expenses, manage budgets, and generate reports. The application demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, and composition, as well as database integration for CRUD operations with SQLite.
